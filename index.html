    <h2>Sensitive skin</h2>
    <p>People with sensitive skin often struggle with wearing jewellery, as certain metals—especially nickel—can cause allergic reactions like redness, itching, or rashes. That’s why choosing high-quality, skin-friendly materials is essential. At Crowned by Her, we prioritize both your comfort and the planet. All our jewellery is crafted from real gold and other hypoallergenic materials, making it safe for sensitive skin. Beyond beauty and wearability, we are committed to sustainability—our metals are ethically sourced and responsibly mined to ensure minimal impact on the environment. With Crowned by Her, you can feel confident wearing luxurious, skin-safe pieces that are as kind to the earth as they are to you.

          <h1>Support the right companies </h1></header>
        <p>Many forward-thinking companies and organizations are taking bold steps to reduce the environmental and social harm caused by traditional mining. Brands like Mejuri, Brilliant Earth, Vrai, Pandora, Monica Vinader, and Crowned by Her are leading the way by using recycled metals, lab-grown or ethically sourced gemstones, and supporting safe, responsible mining practices that protect workers and communities. Tech companies like Apple and Fairphone are also committing to closed-loop production systems that rely more on recycled materials than newly mined resources. Supporting and buying from these companies not only promotes sustainable innovation but also sends a powerful message: that the future of luxury and technology can be ethical, transparent, and environmentally responsible. Choosing these brands is a step toward reducing global mining dependency and protecting our planet.</p>
